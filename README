If a developer wants to make some additions to the code, they need to obtain the code, including the Pipfile, and run the command
pipenv install --dev
The --dev installs all the dependencies needed for development only, but not for production. This includes libraries like pytest,
which may have been installed only for development with the command
pipenv install pytest --dev

To add dependencies from a requirements.txt file to the pipfile, make sure to not be in the virtual environment (pipenv shell)
Then, type the following command:
pipenv install -r {location of requirements.txt file}
To generate the dependencies from the pipfile in a way which can be added to a requirements.txt file, (the opposite of above), type the following command:
pipenv lock -r

To recreate the virtual environment using a different version of python, run the command:
pipenv --python {new version of pythin i.e. 3.6}

To remove the virtual environment completely and recreate it from scratch using the pipfile, run the following commands outside of the virtual environment:
pipenv --rm
pipenv install

Once you're ready to push code to production, run the following command outside of the virtual environment:
pipenv lock
Then, move the Pipfile.lock file to your production environment and run the command:
pipenv install --ignore-pipfile
