This custom chatbot uses local, passed in data to answer questions concerning the local data.
Below are installation instructions:
1) Clone the repository
2) Open a terminal and navigate to the directory
    $...\Open_AI_Person_Project\src\Open_AI_Custom_Chatbot>
3) Type in the command:
    pip install pipenv
    Pipenv will be used to install compatible versions of python packages and sub-dependencies using the pipfile and pipfile.lock
4) Install python dependencies using the command:
    pipenv install --ignore-pipfile

(Optional) Spawn a shell in a virtual environment by typing in the command:
    pipenv shell
While in the virtual environment, you can leave using the command:
    exit
Do NOT use the command deactiviate, as this may not actually exit the virtual environment.

5) Open MainCode.py and insert your OPEN_API_KEY on the first line.
6) Run MainCode.py outside or inside of a virtual environment and enjoy!

To run commands inside a virtual environment without navigating into via pipenv shell, you can type the following command:
    pipenv run {command like python MainCode.py}
Through this method, the virtual environment never gets "activated" per say. Therefore, no exit command is necessary.
